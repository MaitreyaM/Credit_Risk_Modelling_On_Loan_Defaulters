# Credit_Risk_Modelling_On_Loan_Defaulters
This repository features a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling project focused on credit risk. The notebook explores the loan defaulter dataset, applying various machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of default on loans. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The project also highlights techniques like handling imbalanced data and assessing model performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights for financial risk assessment.
